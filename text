1. All of the main functions we need to create are put into the "init" functions 

// SETTING UP THE SCENE

1. Scene -- The stage where every object needs to be added in order to be rendered
2. Camera -- Perspective Camera -- could also be an Orthographic Camera
3. Renderer -- That will display all the scene using WebGL
4. One or more objects to render --- create a plane, sea, and a sky (couple of clouds)
5. One or more lights --- different types of lights available -- mainly use a hemisphere
light for the atmosphere and directional light for the shadows

// INIT Function
1. Will contain all the main functions 
1. createScene -- Set up the scene, camera, and renderer
2. createLights -- Add the lights
3. createPlane (Plane, Sea, Sky) -- Add the objects
4. loop -- To start a loop that will update the object's positions and render the scene on each frame

// CREATE SCENE function
1. The scene, camera, and the renderer will be created

// HANDLE WINDOW RESIZE
1. As the screen size can change, we need to update the renderer size and the camera aspect ratio:

// CREATE LIGHTS Function
1. Will make the objects visible

// CREATE SEA function 
1. Define the Sea object --- Sea = function()
2. Define the Sea function
3. Instantiate the sea with the "createSea" function and add it to the scene

// Create Clouds Object --- Add in random positions of the sky
1. Number of cubes assembled randomly to form one shape --- cube + cube = cloud

// Create Sky Object -- Contains the clouds
1. Create an entire sky by duplicating the clouds objects, and place it around random positions around the z-axis
1. Define a Sky Object

// Creating the airplane
1. Create a new Airplane object
2. Create an empty container
3. Add each piece of the plane into the object (called this.mesh)

// LOOP Function
1. Create an infinite loop
2. this loop will rotate the the sea and clouds
3. this loop will also make the airplane's propeller spin
4. Adding Mouse Event Listener
------ Once the document is loaded, need to add a listener to the document, to check if the mouse is moving
------ modify the init function
------ normalize the x and y position of the mouse

1. In order to create an object:
    1. Create a geometry
    2. Create a material
    3. Pass them into a mesh
    4. Add the mesh to our scene
    5. Combine the objects to create more complex shapes
